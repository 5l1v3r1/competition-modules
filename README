Borne out of the authors experiences at the CCDC and similar compeititions, a need for enhanced persistance and fun modules was recognized. This project provides metasploit modules which are useful at such competitions. Mainly for the red team :)

To utilize these modules, simply pull them down and load them in the framework: 

msf> loadpath /path/to/competition_modules
[+] xx modules loaded.
